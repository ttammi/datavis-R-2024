# Exercise 1: 
# Create a vector named my_vector. It should have 7 numeric elements.

# Print your vector.

# Calculate the minimum, maximum, and median values of your vector.

# Print "The median value is XX"


# Exercise 2: 
# Create another vector named my_vector_2. It should have the elements of my_vector divided by 2.

# Create a vector named my_words. It should have 7 character elements.

# Combine my_vector and my_words into a data frame.

# Show the structure of the data frame.


# Exercise 3:
# Use the head() function to print the first 3 rows of your data frame.

# Create a new variable to the data frame which has the values of my_vector_2 (remember to save the new variable to the data frame object).

# Use filter() to print rows of your data frame where values of my_vector are greater than the median value of my_vector.
