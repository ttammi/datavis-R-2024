This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. You can write text freely outside chunks (see the [Reference Guide](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) for detailed guidance).  

```{r setup}
library(DT)
library(tidyverse)
```


At the top of the .Rmd file is the metadata section, where you can specify the title, author, and date. (You don't need to use quotes for these, except if you have special characters.) The metadata also defines how the output will be rendered. For example, this document is rendered as an HTML Notebook (a bit more about notebooks later), and has a table of contents (toc). See more on metadata specifications at the end of this document.  

# Formatting your document 

Headers are specified with # (and sub-headers with ##, and so on). View document outline from top right corner of the editor.  

Line breaks are made by adding two spaces at the end of the line.  

Here's a list of ways to format text:  

- **bold**  
- *italic*  
- ^superscript^  
- ~subscript~  

You can even add footnotes ^[This is a footnote].  

Click *Preview* to see how the output looks.  

# Executing chunks

Chunks are marked with `{r}` and contain code.  
Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. You can execute one line by pressing *Ctrl+Enter*. Output is shown below the chunk.  
You can run multiple chunks from the top right menu.  

```{r}
5+5
```

```{r}
x <- 10
x
```

Plots will also show below the chunk, instead of the side tab.

```{r}
df <- tibble(x = 1:50, y = x^2)

df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) + geom_point()

```

Tables will be formatted neatly by default. (Note: only in Notebooks.)

```{r}
df
```

The DT library can be used to print out nice tables.

```{r}
DT::datatable(df)
```

#### Adding a new chunk

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I* (on Windows). You can give a name to the chunk (this is useful when knitting Markdown documents).  

**Note that the first chunk of this document is called "setup". It's a name that will cause the chunk to run automatically before any other code. Other chunk names are not tied to any special behaviour.**

```{r chunk_name}

```

#### Chunk options
You can choose to not show warnings or messages (default TRUE). This can be useful e.g. when loading packages.  

```{r}
as.numeric("word")
```

```{r warning=FALSE}
as.numeric("word")
```

You can hide the code chunk (but not the output) with echo=FALSE. Both code and output can be hidden with include=FALSE.  


**Output figure size** can be adjusted in chunk options.  

See the reference guide for more details about chunk options with e.g. plotting.
```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) + geom_point()
```

If you wish to use the same size for all figures, execute `knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 12, fig.height = 6)` in a chunk.


#### Viewing the output document

When you save the notebook, an HTML file (.nb.html) containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). The HTML file can be viewed in a browser.  

**Difference between Markdown (knit) and Notebook (preview)**: unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed. In contrast, when knitting, it is checked that everything you need to run the code successfully is included in the .Rmd file. For this reason, a new R session is started. See what happens if you replace `html_notebook` with `html_document` in the metadata (and save the document)! There are also some differences in how the output looks (for example tables, as shown above).  

R Markdown output can be saved in other formats too, such as pdf, Word, or even PowerPoint.



# *Extra*: Even more formatting

Some nice tips for R Markdown can be found [here](https://holtzy.github.io/Pimp-my-rmd/).

## Creating tabs {.tabset}

### Tab 1
Tab1 content
```{r}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) + geom_point()
```


### Tab 2
Tab 2 content  

```{r}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(y, x)) + geom_point()
```


## Metadata for HTML Notebook

>     output:  
>         html_notebook:  
>             number_sections: true  
>             theme: united  
>             highlight: textmate  


You can select a [theme](https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/) for your output document.  


## HTML

When creating an HTML document, you can also use HTML formatting that will override Markdown specifications, to e.g.  

<p style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:16pt">
    change font or font size.
</p>  

You can also use a separate .css file (see [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#appearance-and-style)).
