This is an introduction to plotting with the **ggplot2** library. We will use the built-in **iris** dataset.

Tidyverse contains ggplot2, so that's all we need here.
```{r message=F}
library(tidyverse)
```

### The iris dataset

*This famous iris data set gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.*

```{r}
iris
```

```{r}
summary(iris)
```

```{r}
str(iris)
```

We can see that the dataset consists of four numeric variables and one **factor** (Species).  

```{r}
levels(iris$Species)
```
### ggplot2

Plotting with ggplot2 consists of components (functions) joined by `+` (not `%>%`!):

- initialise the plot with `ggplot()`: what data do you want to plot?
  - specify the aesthetics mapping with `aes()`: by default, the first two will be x and y variables
- draw the data points with `geom_point()`  
- other (optional) components to create axis labels, colour scales, subplots, ...

If the *geom* component is missing, a blank plot is drawn, because you haven't told ggplot what to draw (points, lines, etc).

```{r}
iris %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) + # x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width
  geom_point()

```

Add a title and a subtitle, and customise axis labels with `labs()`.
```{r}
iris %>%
  ggplot(aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Scatter plot of sepal length and sepal width", subtitle = "Iris dataset", 
       x = "Sepal length (cm)", y = "Sepal width (cm)") 

```

We can add as many geoms to a plot as we want. A regression line can be added with `geom_smooth()`. Confidence interval is plotted by default, and a message about the regression formula is shown (by default, it uses the x and y variables defined in the aesthetics).

```{r}
iris %>%
  ggplot(aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Scatter plot of sepal length and sepal width", subtitle = "Iris dataset", 
       x = "Sepal length (cm)", y = "Sepal width (cm)") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

```

#### A word on aesthetics

Aesthetics (plotted variables) don't need to be specified in the `ggplot()` component (since that's not the component that draws the points), but can be defined within the geom instead. However, this can lead to repetitive code when using multiple geoms.   

When aesthetics are defined in `ggplot()`, they are, by default, *inherited* to the geoms that follow. If needed, this can be overridden by specifying new aesthetics.

```{r}
iris %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) + 
  labs(title = "Scatter plot of sepal length and sepal width", subtitle = "Iris dataset", 
       x = "Sepal length (cm)", y = "Sepal width (cm)") +
  geom_smooth(aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width), method = "lm")

```

#### Plotting categories

Let's set color based on species.  
Categories can also be denoted by e.g. shape instead of (or in addition to) color.

```{r}
iris %>%
  ggplot(aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Scatter plot of sepal length and sepal width", subtitle = "Iris dataset", 
       x = "Sepal length (cm)", y = "Sepal width (cm)") 

```
