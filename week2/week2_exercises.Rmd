# Exercise 1

#### 1.1

Create a new code chunk where you load the tidyverse package. In the chunk settings, suppress any output messages.  



#### 1.2

The tibble *df* has 60 observations (rows) of variables (columns) group, gender, score1 and score2 (continuous scores from two tests). Each row represents one participant.  
```{r include = F}
# this chunk generates the data, and you can ignore it
set.seed(1)
df  <- tibble(group = sample(c(rep(1:2, each=30))),
              gender = sample(c(rep(c('M', 'F'), 28), rep(999,4))),
              score1 = rnorm(60, 18, 2),
              score2 = as.character(runif(60, 0.7, 1.1)*score1))
  
```

```{r}
df
```


There is something to fix in three of the variables. Explore the data and describe what needs to be corrected.  

**Hint**: You can use e.g. str(), distinct(), and summary() to explore the data.  
```{r}

```


# Exercise 2

#### 2.1

Make the corrections you described above.
```{r}

```

#### 2.2

Count observations by group and gender. Arrange by the number of observations (ascending).
```{r}

```


# Exercise 3

#### 3.1

Create a new variable, **score_diff**, that contains the difference between score1 and score2.

```{r}

```

#### 3.2

Compute the means of score1, score2, and score_diff.

**Hint**: Like mutate(), summarise() can take multiple variables in one go.

```{r}

```

#### 3.3

Compute the means of score1, score2, and score_diff **by gender**.

```{r}

```


# Exercise 4

#### 4.1

Using ggplot2, create a scatter plot with score1 on the x-axis and score2 on the y-axis. 
```{r}

```


#### 4.2

Continuing with the previous plot, colour the points based on gender. 

Set the output figure width to 10 and height to 6.


```{r}

```


# Exercise 5

#### 5.1

Add the author (your name) and date into the metadata section. Create a table of contents.  

#### 5.2

Knit your document to HTML by changing `html_notebook` to `html_document` in the metadata, and pressing Knit.
