# Exercise 1

#### 1.1

Create a new code chunk where you load the tidyverse package. In the chunk settings, suppress any output messages.  

```{r setup, message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

```

#### 1.2

The tibble *df* has 60 observations (rows) of variables (columns) group, gender, score1 and score2 (continuous scores from two tests). Each row represents one participant.  
```{r include = F}
# this chunk generates the data, and you can ignore it
set.seed(1)
df  <- tibble(group = sample(c(rep(1:2, each=30))),
              gender = sample(c(rep(c('M', 'F'), 28), rep(999,4))),
              score1 = rnorm(60, 18, 2),
              score2 = as.character(runif(60, 0.7, 1.1)*score1))
  
```

```{r}
df
```


There is something to fix in three of the variables. Explore the data and describe what needs to be corrected.  

**Hint**: You can use e.g. str(), distinct(), and summary() to explore the data.    

**Based on summary(), the group variable is numeric, even though it should be categorical (factor). Also, score2 is a character variable, but it should be numeric.**

**Looking at the distinct values of group and gender reveals that some value of gender has been coded as "999". These need to be changed into NA (missing).**
```{r}
summary(df) # group is numeric, and score2 is character

df %>%
  distinct(group, gender) # gender has missing values coded as "999"

```


# Exercise 2

#### 2.1

Make the corrections you described above.

**Note: if you convert gender to factor before recoding the "999" values, "999" will still remain in the factor levels (although there are no observations; see `levels(df$gender)`). This might cause some problems later (but not in these exercises).**

```{r}
df <- df %>%
  mutate(group = factor(group),
         score2 = as.numeric(score2)) %>%
  mutate(gender = na_if(gender, "999") %>% factor)

```

```{r}
summary(df)
```


#### 2.2

Count observations by group and gender. Arrange by the number of observations (ascending).
```{r}
df %>% 
  count(group, gender) %>%
  arrange(n) # ascending by default; use desc() for descending
```


# Exercise 3

#### 3.1

Create a new variable, **score_diff**, that contains the difference between score1 and score2.

```{r}
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(score_diff = score1 - score2)
```

#### 3.2

Compute the means of score1, score2, and score_diff.

**Hint**: Like mutate(), summarise() can take multiple variables in one go.

```{r}

df %>%
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), mean))

# OR:
# df %>%
#   summarise(across(score1:score_diff, mean))

# OR:
# df %>%
#   summarise(score1 = mean(score1),
#             score2 = mean(score2),
#             score_diff = mean(score_diff))
  
```

#### 3.3

Compute the means of score1, score2, and score_diff **by gender**.

```{r}
df %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), mean)) %>%
  ungroup()

```


# Exercise 4

#### 4.1

Using ggplot2, create a scatter plot with score1 on the x-axis and score2 on the y-axis. 
```{r}

df %>%
  ggplot(aes(score1, score2)) + geom_point()

```


#### 4.2

Continuing with the previous plot, colour the points based on gender. 

Set the output figure width to 10 and height to 6.


```{r fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(score1, score2, colour = gender)) + geom_point()

```


# Exercise 5

#### 5.1

Add the author (your name) and date into the metadata section. Create a table of contents.  

#### 5.2

Knit your document to HTML by changing `html_notebook` to `html_document` in the metadata, and pressing Knit.
