# Exercise 1

#### 1.1

Read the *region_scores.csv* data into R. It should have 240 observations of 6 variables.  

```{r}

```


#### 1.2

Cut the continuous variable **age** into a categorical variable **age_group** that has groups of width 10. Use ggplot2's cutting function.  

Count observations by age group.

```{r}

```


# Exercise 2

The chunk below is supposed to produce a plot but it has some errors.  

The figure should be a scatter plot of **age** on the x-axis and **score** on the y-axis, with points coloured by **education level** (3 levels). It should also have three linear regression lines, one for each of the education levels.  

Fix the code to produce the right figure.  

What happens if you use `geom_jitter()` instead of `geom_point()`?  

**Hint**: Examine the code bit by bit: start by plotting just the scatter plot without `geom_smooth()`, and add the regression lines last.  

```{r}
df %>% 
  ggplot(age, score) + geom_point(color = education) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

```


# Exercise 3

#### 3.1

Calculate the mean, standard deviation (sd), and number of observations (n) of **score by education and age group**. Also calculate the standard error of the mean (by using sd and n). Save these into a new data frame (or tibble) named edu_age_stats.  

```{r}

```

#### 3.2

Using edu_age_stats, plot a bar plot that has **age group** on the x-axis, **mean score** on the y-axis, and **education levels** in subplots (facets).  

Use `geom_errorbar()` to add error bars that represent standard errors of the mean.  

```{r}

```


# Exercise 4

#### 4.1

Create a figure that has boxplots of **score** (x-axis) by **region** (y-axis).  

```{r}

```

#### 4.2

Group the data by region and add mean score by region to a new column **mean_score**. Do this with **`mutate()`** (not `summarise()`). 

Reorder the levels of region based on mean_score.  

**Hint**: Remember to ungroup after creating the mean_score variable.  

```{r}

```


# Exercise 5

Using the data you modified in exercise 4.2, plot **mean scores** (x-axis) by **region** (y-axis) as points. The regions should be ordered by mean score.  

Use `stat_summary()` to add error bars that represent standard errors of the mean.  

**Hint**: Be careful which variable - mean_score or score - you're plotting in each of the geoms.  

```{r}

```
